Module 8 Requirement

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well?
 
  The DriverPass project was a project for a company that wanted to better prepare student for their driving tests. They wanted an online pplatform where students could schedule driving tests as well as test online practice tests. I beleive I laided out the requirements for the system in a way that all parties could understand them.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would create a better Bussiness requirements documnet that is more organized and include a more comprehensive list of requirements.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  Well the client is always the boss and who at the end of the day is paying for the product, therefor we should value their opinion and input for the software we are creating is their vision.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  For DriverPass I would assemble an Agily-Scrum team to work in intervals to accomplish this programs requiremnet within the set deadline.
